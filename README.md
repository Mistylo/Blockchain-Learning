# Simple Blockchain with Python

## Overview
This project is a minimalistic implementation of a blockchain built using Python. It was developed as part of my learning journey to better understand blockchain technology, its underlying principles, and its practical applications. The project was created by following a detailed tutorial series available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sniVXNGeA7Y&list=PLc80fs2KJTAwjfBq9ipBB1BJRlQAOnFba).

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with the following:
- Understanding how a blockchain works.
- Learning how blocks are created, validated, and connected.
- Exploring the core concepts of decentralization and security in blockchain technology.

## Features
- **Block creation**: Generate new blocks containing data and link them to the blockchain.
- **Hashing**: Use cryptographic hashing for block validation.
- **Simple proof-of-work**: Simulate the process of mining to add blocks to the chain.

## Credits
Special thanks to the tutorial author for providing an excellent learning resource. You can find the original tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sniVXNGeA7Y&list=PLc80fs2KJTAwjfBq9ipBB1BJRlQAOnFba).
